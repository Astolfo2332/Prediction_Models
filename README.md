# Advanced Modeling and Simulation of Biological Signals

This repository contains the comprehensive set of laboratory exercises and final project for the course "Models and Simulation." The course focused on adapting various models to biological signals using multiple regression techniques, data interpolation, and signal filtering methods. The project aimed to develop and refine models through ARX, ARMAX, BJ, and EO regressions, predict biological signal behaviors, and apply Fourier methods for filtering invasive signals such as 60 Hz noise.

## Objectives 

- Model Adaptation: Utilize different regression techniques (ARX, ARMAX, BJ, and EO) to fit and predict biological signals.

- Data Interpolation: Apply interpolation methods to enhance prediction accuracy for biological signals.

- Signal Filtering: Implement Fourier-based filtering techniques to remove invasive signal noise, such as 60 Hz interference.

- Graphical Inferences: Generate and analyze graphical representations, such as Bode plots and comparison charts, to visualize model performance and signal characteristics.

-Distensibility Modeling: Develop and refine a distensibility model to analyze the compliance of biological tissues or vessels based on the data.

## Repository Contents

- Laboratory Exercises: Detailed scripts and notebooks for each lab session, showcasing different aspects of modeling, regression, and signal processing.

- Final Project Code: Complete codebase for the final project, including model adaptation, data interpolation, and filtering processes.

- Documentation: Instructions, methodology, and explanations for each stage of the project, including theoretical background and practical implementation details.
